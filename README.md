# NOTES_APP
This is a notes app created in the Django Framework
This was the second project that I created using Django framework during the summer break of year 2023.

Features:
1. User can either signup for the first time or login into the app for accessing their notes
2. With the help of this a user can perform all the CRUD operations on thier notes and view them on their screen
